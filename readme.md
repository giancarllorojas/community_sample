## Code Sample

I've worked two weeks on this project. The first week was mainly prototyping the UI in Figma. The second week, I've started implementing the design components using Nuxt & Vue, so there's no backend. Unfortunately, the client had an issue with his investors and asked me to pause the project indefinitely.
